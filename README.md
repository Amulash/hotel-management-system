# Problem Statement : 
To provide an application to the receptionist, managers and owners, an easy way for searching rooms, listing rooms, inserting the customer information and getting details about customers for a list of hotels.

# Overview : 
This Hotel Management System is made for managers, owners and receptionist. It helps receptionist to digitally handle bookings, service types, payments and customers. Managers and owners can easily get information of all hotels he/she manage and own.
	 When a customer enters the hotel, he/she has to go to the counter for booking rooms. The receptionist will see the room status and will provide every information to customer like room types and service types etc. If the customer is ready for booking rooms, the receptionist needs to enter every general information of customer.
	 If by chance rooms are not available in that hotel then receptionist can easily check room status of other branches of same hotel in same city and provide information to customer. If customer is ready, receptionist can book in other branches also, thus receptionist can avoid customer going away from their hotels.
